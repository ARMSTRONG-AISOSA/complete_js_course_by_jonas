// ======== 008 A Brief Introduction to JavaScript

// PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE: A programming language is a tool (formal system of communication) used by humans to instruct computers to perform specific tasks.

// Types of Programming Languages:

// 1. Low-Level Languages:
// Machine Language: The most basic type of programming language, consisting of binary code that the computer's CPU can execute directly.
// Assembly Language: A step above machine language, using symbolic names for operations and memory addresses, making it more readable than binary.

// 2. High-Level Languages:
// These languages are closer to human languages and further from machine language. They are designed to be easy to read and write. Examples include Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript.

// WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT
// JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on the web.

// Key Features of JavaScript

// 1. Interpreted Language: JavaScript code is executed by web browsers directly without the need for prior compilation. This makes it a lightweight and efficient scripting language.

// 2. Event-Driven: JavaScript is often used to respond to user interactions such as clicks, form submissions, and mouse movements, enabling dynamic web page behaviors.

// 3. Object-Oriented: JavaScript supports object-oriented programming principles, allowing developers to create reusable and modular code using objects, classes (introduced in ES6), and inheritance.

// 4. Functional Programming: JavaScript supports first-class functions, meaning functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. This enables functional programming techniques.

// 5. Prototype-Based Inheritance: Instead of classical inheritance (like in Java or C++), JavaScript uses prototypes. Objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects, promoting code reuse and flexibility.

// 6. Cross-Platform: JavaScript runs in virtually all modern web browsers, making it a cross-platform language. It can also be used on the server side with environments like Node.js.

// Common Uses of JavaScript

// 1. Web Development: Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript is widely used to create interactive web pages, handle user inputs, manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), and control multimedia.

// 2. Server-Side Scripting: With Node.js, JavaScript can be used on the server to handle backend logic, manage databases, and handle HTTP requests and responses.

// 3. Mobile App Development: Frameworks like React Native allow developers to build cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript.

//  4. Desktop Application Development: Tools like Electron enable the development of desktop applications using web technologies, including JavaScript.

// 5. Game Development: JavaScript, along with HTML5, is used to create browser-based games and interactive graphics using libraries like Phaser and Three.js.

// 6. APIs and Services: JavaScript is commonly used to interact with web APIs, fetch data from servers using AJAX or the Fetch API, and handle asynchronous operations with promises and async/await.

// Evolution of JavaScript

// ES5 (ECMAScript 5): Introduced in 2009, brought features like strict mode, JSON support, and new array methods.

// ES6 (ECMAScript 2015): Introduced major enhancements like classes, modules, arrow functions, template literals, promises, and more. This version greatly improved JavaScriptâ€™s capabilities and readability.

// Subsequent Versions (ES7, ES8, etc.): Continued to add new features and improvements, such as async/await, new array methods, and more.
